                This project is intended to implement Artificial Intelligence
                with Cyber Security, The main goal of the project is to make an
                AI that can gather information on a specified target and search
                for the best possible exploits and all the vulnerabilities on
                the target using tools that are used by a Cyber Sec professional
                during a Pentest. The main agenda of this tool is to ease the
                Pentesting process by a little by completing the enumeration and
                recon part of the process and this will also help in the final

                        The research paper explores the challenges faced by cloud computing due to the rapid growth of the IoT
                            and proposes fog computing as a solution. The paper focuses on load balancing in fog computing and
                                  discusses various algorithms and approaches to optimize resource utilization and reduce energy
                               consumption by increasing the data centers and building an reliable infrastructure. The proposed model
                     aims to increase the processing power of fog architecture by increasing the number of data centers,
                             resulting in a more powerful and reliable infrastructure.
